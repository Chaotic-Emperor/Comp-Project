                <p>Audrey is a noble and comes from an influential family. With her father as an earl and with say over the governmental decisions, she grew up not having to worry about money whatsoever leading to ignorance in the difficult lives of the people living below the poverty line. Being the youngest child in her family, she was sheltered by everyone else and didn't have to worry about taking over the family either leading to a carefree and blissful life.</p>
