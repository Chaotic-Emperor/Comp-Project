                    The Hidden Sage is an embodiment of knowledge itself. "He" is chasing usâ€”every single Moses Ascetic Order member. When too much knowledge is injected into us, without us being able to quickly digest and master it, a situation like before would happen. Either I lower my defenses and open my mind to accept the modifications from the Hidden Sage, or I would tenaciously resist it or end up losing control.

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Cattleya was an unknown child who was adopted by Queen Mystic, Bernadette Gustav, when she was still a child. Bernadette, being the daughter of Roselle Gustav, a transmigrator and a widely renowned emperor hailed for bringing about revolution, taught Cattleya the ins and outs of life with a proper knowledge of mysticism. Cattleya considers Bernadette to be her mother figure, teacher, and captain. She was later expelled from the fleet after which she created her own fleet and became renowned as a general of the seas. <br>Cattleya joined the Tarot Card gathering after being pulled above the grey fog by <a href="klein.html">Mr Fool</a> after she almost lost control from the murmurings of Hidden Sage. She then tried to test <a href="klein.html">Mr Fool</a> and glean into his identity but was largely reprimanded by him.</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Cattleya has black hair and purple eyes standing at a height of 1.66 meters.

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Cattleya appears to be a keen, observant, and cautious lady. She is a capable captain leading a massive fleet with a lot of subordinates at an equivalent strength. She is a curious enough beyonder that she chooses to try and pry into the secrets of many people and have enough weapons to use against other people which led her to pry into the secrets of <a href="klein.html">Mr Fool</a> as well. <br><span class="spoiler">It is later revealed that she is not as mature as she appears to be and still longs for a place in Bernadette's fleet. She wishes for he to come back and take her back to the ship waiting for her mother-figure. She has the mindset of a small child which she is able to supress most of the time. </span></p>
