                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Fors Wall was originally a doctor who by chance happened to come across a beyonder that was dying. The beyonder was a member of the Abraham Family who, when she was dying, left her artifacts and beyonder characteristic for Fors to consume after which she became a beyonder. <br>She then started to write books based on the journal and books left behind by the patient which helped her become a best-selling author. She is good friends with Xio Derecha (The Judgement) and <a href="audrey.html">Audrey Hall (Miss Justice)</a></p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Fors is about 1.65 meters in height slightly curly brown hair and pale blue eyes. She dresses normally, not having much money to spare for clothing properly. In fact, her growth as a beyonder had been gatekept by the fact that she didn't have enough money to attend beyonder gatherings and purchase said materials.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Similar to stereotyped authors, Fors Wall is a lazy person who chooses to enjoy life and postpone her responsibilities in order to enjoy said tasks. She isn't particularly interested in fooling others and acts honestly which also earned her the trust of Xio and <a href="audrey.html">Audrey</a> She also likes to smoke and drink as potrayed of stereotypical authors. <br> <span class="spoiler">Later, after being involved in a multitude of events, gaining proper connections in the tarot club and having someone famous who she could write her novels on <a href="klein.html">Gerhman Sparrow (The World),</a> she chooses to pursue her abilities as a beyonder and even choosing to embark on the path of being a demi-god.</span></p>
