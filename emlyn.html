                    What's wrong with being a vampire? Do you think vampires should be locked up here? Do I have to listen to your nagging and scripture recitals every day? Bullshit, I'm a noble Sanguine, so don't use such a vulgar name to describe me!

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Emlyn is a vampire from the sanguine tribe. He is someone that is obsessed with dolls who uses most of his resources for his doll collection. He works as a doctor making use of his skills, among which is bloodletting, which allows for some food <br>During one of those days, he caught a thief who gave him a key which had the effects of getting lost, due to which he got caught by a father from the Church of the Earth Mother. He was then brainwashed by the father and became a follower of Church of the Earth Mother, mostly the kindness and a desire to go to the church once in a while. He still believes in Church of the Fool but has quite some loyalty to Church of Earth Mother</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Emlyn has the generic Sanguine looks with black hair and red eyes, possessing a high nose and thin lips. He is someone handsome who doesn't give off masculine vibes because of his obsession with dolls which leads him to be indifferent to everyone else, acting very haughty and noble, which is actually unbecoming of a noble. He has his hair usually combed back in a slanted fashion with a hint of elegance in his appearance.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Emlyn is prideful and always has the intention of not letting any disrespect come along his way. He makes sure to rebuke people for them calling him vampires and repeated reminds others that he is a sanguine and not a vampire, even if it means exposing his identity. He is not that honest of a person; however, he is not that shrewd either because of his lack of life experience, his distaste for humans, and his love for inanimate dolls. Because of his pridefulness, he has also developed a lot of arrogance and has become delusional to the extent even though his elders wished to use his as a scapegoat, he views himself as a messiah who is going to save the sanguine. </p>
