                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Leonard Mitchell was an orphan in the Church of the Evernight who was given preferential behaviour that allowed him to get close to other people. After growing up, he managed to embark on the path of divinity serving the Church of Evernight as a beyonder. He was then, at a certain point in time, parasitised by Pallez Zoroast who he became accomplices with and allowed for both their growth; Pallez used his body for recovery while Leonard learned about mysticism from Pallez Zoroast. <br>After the start of the story, he is seen working on several cases alongside <a href="klein.html">Klein Moretti (The World).</a> He had the peculiar behaviour of acting as if he was the protagonist of the show and commonly exuded a superior air about himself which he chose to share to klein exclusively. After the big event, in Tingen city, he decided to hide his actual skills and was sent to Backlund to act as a Red Gloves member</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Leonard is about 1.80 meters with black hair and green eyes. He exudes the air of a poet and has been noted to be good looking with even <a href="audrey.html">Audrey Hall (Justice)</a> commenting that he could have been a model if he had chosen to work on his behaviour. <a href="emlyn.html">Emlyn White (Moon)</a> had also indicated that his appearance was similar to that of Sanguines which is a form of respect as Emlyn considers Sanguine to be the greatest creation.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Leonard has a laid back personality, usually not choosing to act casually even in formal occassions. He chooses to even put his feet up on the table because that is what seems most comfortable for him. Being prideful due to his upbringing and the paraticism by Pallez, he chooses to believe that he is the protagonist having a sense of grandeur delusion. After the event in Tingen, he lost some of his pride seeing his powerlessness but still reamins proud overall. <br>Leonard also has great skills in his day to day life, the certainty of which cannot be confirmed as Pallez is shown guiding him through many points of life. He also has the bravery to hurt himself if it means saving himself in the long run as shown by his willingness to pull out his fingernail to maintain his self.</p>
